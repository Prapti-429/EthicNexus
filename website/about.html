        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          The AI Ethics Compliance System (AECS) was created to bridge the gap
          between rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and the growing
          need for ethical standards. As AI systems increasingly influence
          critical sectors such as healthcare, finance, and education, ensuring
          their fairness, accountability, and transparency has become essential.
          AECS is dedicated to providing a platform that enforces ethical
          principles and fosters trust in AI technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          By leveraging cutting-edge technologies like blockchain and AI
          governance frameworks, AECS aims to eliminate biases, promote
          accountability, and enable organizations to comply with global
          standards. We believe that ethical AI is not just a technical
          requirement but a moral imperative that drives responsible innovation.

        <h2>Our Technology Stack</h2>
        <p>
          The foundation of AECS lies in its robust and innovative technology
          stack. At the core is blockchain technology, which ensures
          transparency and traceability in AI operations. Blockchain provides an
          immutable ledger where every action and decision made by an AI system
          is securely recorded, fostering accountability and trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to blockchain, AECS incorporates AI governance frameworks
          that enforce ethical guidelines and promote compliance with
          international standards. These frameworks are complemented by advanced
          bias detection algorithms, which analyze data and models to uncover
          hidden patterns that may lead to unfair outcomes. By integrating these
          technologies, AECS offers a holistic approach to AI ethics.
